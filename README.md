Hi there! I am Maxim from Brazil, specializing in back-end and chatbot development for the Telegram platform. In addition, I create websites using various builders. My experience also includes working with Telegram-SMM and product management.

I am passionate about learning Python as well as various frameworks such as Django and DRF. My skills include working with the Telebot and Aiogram libraries, as well as experience with Tilda and GetCourse.
